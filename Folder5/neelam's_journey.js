Description:
Neelam has N friends studying in various schools. 
She wants to find a new friend in (N+1)th school. 
Assume all schools are separated by 1 unit distance. 
To reach (N+1)th school she has to board a bus.
The ith school would cost of C[i] rupees to travel 1 unit of distance. 
In other words, the bus fare to travel from the ith school to the jth school is abs(i â€“ j ) * C[i] rupees.
The task is to find the minimum bus fare to travel from school 1 to school(N + 1)i.e. beyond the last school.

Input:
Input Format:
First Line Consists of Single integerN
Second Line Consists of N integers separated by spaces.
(Cost to travel 1 unit distance from ith school)

Constraints:
1 < =N<= 10^6
1 <=C[i]<= 10000

Output:
Print the minimum cost to travel.

Sample Input:
5
4 7 8 3 4

Sample Output:
18

Hint:
Sample 1 Explanation
Board the bus at the first school then change the bus at the fourth school.
(3 * 4) + (2 * 3) = 12 + 6 = 18
