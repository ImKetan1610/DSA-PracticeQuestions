/*

Problem Statement:
You are given a number stored in a variable with the name, nums
You have to find the value of the number raised to the power of 4
For example, if the value stored in num = 3. 
    Therefore, the value of 3 raised to the power of 4, equals3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81, which is the required answer
Therefore, the output is 81

Input:
The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored in num

Output:
You have to print the value of the number, stored in num, raised to the power of 4

Sample Input:
3

Sample Output:
81

Hint:
In the sample test case, the value stored in num = 3. 
    Therefore, the value of 3 raised to the power of 4, means3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81, which is the required answer

*/

function powerOf4(num) {
  // Write code here
  console.log(num ** 4);
}
