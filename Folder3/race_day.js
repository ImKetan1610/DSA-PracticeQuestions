/*

Problem Statement:
You are given four distinct integers a, b, c, d.
Sachin and three other people are running a marathon.
The value a is the distance that Sachin has run and b, c, d 
    correspond to the distances the other three participants ran.
Output the number of participants in front of Sachin.

Input:
Input Format:
The first line contains the number of test cases t.
Next t lines contain the description of the t testcases.
The first and the only line of eah testcase contains 4 distinct integers - a, b, c, and d.

Constraints:
1 <=t<= 10^4
0 <=a,b,c,d<= 10^5

Output:
Output Format:
For each test case, output a single integer â€” the number of participants in front of Sachin.


Sample Input:
4
2 3 4 1
10000 0 1 2
500 600 400 300
0 9999 10000 9998

Sample Output:
2
0
1
3

Hint:
First Testcase
For the first test case, there are 2 people in front of Sachin, 
    specifically the participants who ran distances of 3 and 4.
The other participant is not in front of Sachin because he ran a shorter distance than Sachin.

Second Testcase
For the second test case, no one is in front of Sachin, 
    since he ran a distance of 10000 while all others ran a distance of 0, 1, and 2 respectively.

Third Testcase
For the third test case, only the second person is in front of Sachin, 
    who ran a total distance of 600 while Sachin ran a distance of 500.
